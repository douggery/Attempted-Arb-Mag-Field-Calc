# Attempted-Arb-Mag-Field-Calc
Early attempt at an arbitary magnetic field calculator

A magnetic field simulator was combined with a genetic algorithm
in an attempt to have the computer design a magnetic coil
array that generated the appropriate magnetic field for 
laser cooling atoms. 

This is meant to interface with the interesting world of
photochemical etching which is able to make high-current, planar,
and precise designs in copper.

The design below was successfully fabricated and stackable
